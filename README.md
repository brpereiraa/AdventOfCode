## Advent Of Code
This repository has my solutions for the exercises I managed to finish during the Advent of Code of 2023 and will be updated as more challenges are finished.
However, they won't be the most efficient way to go about them, as this was a way of learning a new language.

## Language Used
The challenges were done in **Rust**. They aren't done in the most efficient way and could be improved by a lot. However, this was only a repository made to learn the language.

To run the challenges, make sure you have **Cargo** installed and to compile the code run...
```
Cargo run
```
